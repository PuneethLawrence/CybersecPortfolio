My Name is Puneeth Lawrence and I am intrested in the field of cybersecurity. I am a driven cybersecurity enthusiast with a Certification in CEH 

My Objective is to leverage my technical expertise, I aim to showcase my projects and their real-world applications as a testament to my skills and dedication to the field.

# Projects

## Setting Up A NAT Network

As part of a hands-on project, I successfully created a NAT (Network Address Translation) network to connect multiple virtual machines (VMs) within a controlled environment. Utilizing VirtualBox, I configured a NAT network to facilitate seamless communication between the VMs while isolating them from the external network. Each VM was assigned a private IP.

## Nessus Report

I used Nessus to scan a Windows 10 machine and identify potential vulnerabilities. After setting up the scan, I configured Nessus to perform a comprehensive network vulnerability assessment, targeting the machine’s open ports, services, and software configurations. The scan highlighted several issues, such as outdated software versions, missing security patches, and weak configurations, all of which could be exploited by attackers. Nessus provided detailed reports on each vulnerability, including their severity levels, and suggested remediation steps to mitigate the risks. This allowed me to gain a clear understanding of the security weaknesses in the Windows 10 system, helping me identify areas for improvement in its defenses.

## Exploiting and Gaining Access to a Machine

I exploited a Windows 7 machine using Kali Linux and a few tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and the EternalBlue vulnerability. First, I ran an Nmap scan on the target machine to check for open ports and services, which revealed that SMB (port 445) was active—this was key for exploiting EternalBlue. Once I confirmed the machine was vulnerable, I used Metasploit and the exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue module to take advantage of the flaw. This allowed me to execute remote code on the system. After gaining access, I was able to run commands and potentially access sensitive data, which highlights the importance of patching known vulnerabilities to prevent attacks like this.
